## User Guide

### Brief Overview of Game:

  In this game you are the frog, you control him with the arrow keys. Your goal is to try to get across the street and through the river over to one of you lily pads. 
  There are cars in the street that you must avoid being run over by. Then once in the river you must walk across the tops of the moving turtles in order to make it safely though the river. 
  Then once you are at the edge of the river you must jump from the backs on one of the turtles to one of the lily pads. If you do this successfully you will be reset to the starting position. You have 3 lives and if you are hit by a car, run out of time or fall into the river you lose a life and are reset to the starting position. The way the game advances is that you have a time limit on how long you can take to get to a lily pad. You start out with an initial time of 60 seconds, every time you reach a lily pad you intitial time is reduced by 5 seconds, so 60 → 55 → 50 → etc... The way you win the game is by getting your initial time down to 10 seconds and then getting to one of your lily pads in under 10 seconds. If you do this you have won the game.
